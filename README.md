1) Put all python files under the same directory.
2) Run run_all_accumulate.py to start the simulation.
3) Read data on npc_analysis_accumulated.csv and npc_type_counts_accumulated.csv

Notes:
Ensure all files are in the same directory.
Change days_run in run_all_accumulate.py to set the duration of the simulation.
The script gives cumulative data over the set days in npc_analysis_accumulated.csv and npc_type_counts_accumulated.csv
