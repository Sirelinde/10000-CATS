The CSV files in this directory result from increasing citizen awareness of the pet abandonment situation from 30% to 40%.
This change may have resulted from educational efforts from schools, charities, advocates and the government to highlight the situation, such that more citizens are not just aware of it but also learn how to avoid contributing to the phenomenon (for example, they may be less inclined to buy from pet shops and be more wary when seeing online ads from breeders).
A 10% decrease is ambitious, but perhaps possible with many years of educational campaigns.

RESULTS:
1) There is a noticeable decrease in the number of cats killed. The number of abandoned cats also decreased, suggesting this may be the reason for the lowered number of killed cats.
2) LAP and SPCA are still running losses but it is less severe than originally. The greatest contributor to this change is increased donations to these charities.
3) More cats are getting adopted and fewer are bought. As a result, pet shops and breeders are earning less than originally.
4) MORE cats were surrendered by owners to the animal shelters. This was unexpected because I thought the opposite would happen. Either this was a fluke in the code, or it may reflect a real phenomenon where, instead of simply abandoning the cats, the owners bring them to the shelters. It is an interesting observation.
