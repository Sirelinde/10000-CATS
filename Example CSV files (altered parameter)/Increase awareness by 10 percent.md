The CSV files in this directory result from increasing citizen awareness of the pet abandonment situation from 30% to 40%.
This change may have resulted from educational efforts from schools, charities, advocates and the government to highlight the situation, such that more citizens are not just aware of it but also learn how to avoid contributing to the phenomenon (for example, they may be less inclined to buy from pet shops and be more wary when seeing online ads from breeders).
A 10% decrease is ambitious, but perhaps possible with many years of educational campaigns.

RESULTS:
1) I noticed that changing this parameter resulted in MORE cats being surrendered by owners to the animal shelters. This was unexpected because I thought the opposite would happen. Either this was a fluke in the code, or it may reflect a real phenomenon where, instead of simply abandoning the cats, the owners bring them to the shelters. It is an interesting observation.
