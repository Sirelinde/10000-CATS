The original parameters in the Python codes seem to give rise to values similar to those described within the Case Study.

MAIN OBSERVATIONS:

None of the establishments are earning money except for breeders.
This observation aligns well with the reports given about the struggles of LAP (and SPCA) as charities, as well as the AFCD as an under-funded government department.
All three stakeholders run massive losses.

People who buy cats vastly outnumber those who adopt, and most cats are bought from pet shops, with unethical breeders gaining huge profits from supplying these shops.

Approximately 7000 cats would be killed each year, mostly by the AFCD (as reflected in their euthanasia costs).
